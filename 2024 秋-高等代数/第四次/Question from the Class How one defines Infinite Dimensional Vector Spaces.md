Question from the Class: *How one defines Infinite Dimensional Vector Spaces?*

**Notation** Let $\mathbb F$ be the ambient field. $V$ is an $\mathbb F$-vector space. 

**Definition A1** (from *Linear Algebra Done Right*) Say $V$ is of infinite dimension, iff $V$ is not finite dimensional.

**Definition A2** Say $V$ is of infinite dimension, iff there exists a subset $S\subset V$ such that 

1. $S$ is linearly independent, and
2. $S$ is infinite ($S$ is not a finite set). 

**Exercise** Prove that ** Definition A1** and **Definition A2** are equivalent. Is it a trivial statement? 

**Definition** Set $S\subset [0,1]$. Say $x_0\in S$ is an accumulating point, iff the following statement is true: 
$$
\forall \varepsilon>0, \exists \delta>0, \forall x\in S 
$$
